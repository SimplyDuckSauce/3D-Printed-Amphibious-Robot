## Fabrication Techniques Used
* Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM)
* Stereolithography (SLA)
* Pellet Printing (optional)

## Bill of material:
* Electronics (Note: Reevaluation of Electronics Recommended)
  * Raspberry Pi Pico H (x1)
  * L298N Motor Controller(x2)
  * Buck Converter (x1)
  * 35T Motors (x4)

* Printing Materials
  * ELEGOO ABS-Like Photopolymer Resin 
  * NinjaTek Chinchilla TPU
  * Standard Polylactic Acid (PLA) filament
  * 30A Pellets (optional)

## Fabrication of Chassis and Lid
* Chassis and Lid were SLA printed with ELEGOO ABS-Like Photopolymer Resin. This was due to the need for the body of the robot to be waterproof as resin is known to make great water-tight components.

## Fabrication of Wheels
* Wheels were fabricated FDM using standard PLA. This was chosen to save weight as the wheels did not need to be water-tight.

## Fabrication of Motor Seals and washers
* The motor seals and washers were printed out of NinjaTek Chinchilla TPU. These components were designed to mimic rubber water seals and o-rings which the TPU material does nicely. However, these could also be printed using 30A pellets.

# Results

## Buoyancy
The robot proved to float when placed into a bucket of water. Although no testing was able to be done to traverse through the water, it is believed that with the paddle wheels the robot would have no issue in doing so.
